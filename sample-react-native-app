Create a Sample React Native app with ios and android modules

Pre-requisites: Follow the steps to create a sample app (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

This will create a project AwesomeProject

Open the project in the editor which you use(vscode, sublime, atom etc)

Open package.json 
Edit the dependencies and devDependencies to have the below mentioned versions

  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.0.0",
    "react-native": "^0.49.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-preset-react-native-stage-0": "^1.0.1",
    "jest": "^23.0.1",
    "jest-react-native": "^18.0.0",
    "react-test-renderer": "16.3.1"
  }
  
Replace the default .babelrc file contents with the below presets
  
{
  "presets": [
    "babel-preset-react-native-stage-0/decorator-support"
  ],
  "env": {
    "development": {
      "plugins": [
        "transform-react-jsx-source"
      ]
    }
  }
}

You could also add scripts to package.json

"scripts": {
  "start": "react-native start",
  "android": "react-native run-android",
  "ios": "react-native run-ios",
  "test": "jest"
}

Open app.json file and add expo - sdk version

{
  "expo": {
    "sdkVersion": "27.0.0"
  },
  "name": "cureitmobileapp",
  "displayName": "cureitmobileapp"
}

Save these files

Run the below command

For ios

npm run ios (if you add scripts give above) 
    or
react-native run-ios

For android

npm run android (if you add scripts give above) 
    or
react-native run-android

This will build the respective apps and will open the app in their respective emulators.

You should be able to view the app running on the emulator.
